class_name FloodFill
extends RefCounted
## Pure ITERATIVE flood fill over an abstract cell space -- the core of the Bucket Fill tool.
## Never recursive (recursion stack-overflows on large fills); uses an explicit BFS queue +
## a visited Dictionary. Node-free and headless-testable: the caller injects `read` and
## `neighbors` Callables, so this same logic drives an in-memory grid in tests and a live
## TileMapLayer at runtime (iso neighbor topology differs -- never hardcode offsets).

## Reads a cell's CURRENT identity. Contract:
##   read: func(cell: Vector2i) -> Dictionary { "src": int, "atlas": Vector2i }
## `src` is the tile source id (-1 == empty, per BrushCore.EMPTY_SOURCE_ID; NEVER 0),
## `atlas` its atlas coords. At runtime this wraps
## get_cell_source_id(cell)/get_cell_atlas_coords(cell); in tests an in-memory Dictionary
## lookup defaulting absent cells to { "src": -1, "atlas": Vector2i(-1, -1) }.
##
## Returns adjacent cells. Contract:
##   neighbors: func(cell: Vector2i) -> Array[Vector2i]
## At runtime wraps TileMapLayer.get_surrounding_cells(cell) (respects iso topology); in
## tests a deterministic 4-neighbor (N/E/S/W) function. Offsets are NEVER hardcoded here.

## Computes the contiguous region of the SEED's original identity `(match_src, match_atlas)`
## reachable from `seed` via `neighbors`, iteratively (BFS). A cell is part of the region iff
## `read(cell).src == match_src and read(cell).atlas == match_atlas`. `match_src`/`match_atlas`
## are captured by the CALLER (the seed's current contents) and held fixed -- nothing mutates
## during compute (read-only), so the seed's identity is not re-read as the walk proceeds.
##
## Guards:
##   - bounds: only cells with `bounds.has_point(cell)` are ever considered/enqueued. This
##     bounds an otherwise-infinite TileMapLayer (filling empty space would never terminate).
##   - max_cells: hard cap. Once the result reaches `max_cells` we stop and return a PARTIAL
##     region -- a defensive termination guarantee even inside finite bounds.
##   - Out-of-bounds seed -> returns []. The seed defines the matched identity, so an in-bounds
##     seed is always included.
## Returns a typed Array[Vector2i] in deterministic BFS order.
